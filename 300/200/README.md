# 200 - Step 2: Adding Tasks to Your Rindle Board

Now that you have a brand spankin’ new board and a few lists, it’s time to add Tasks! 

As we established earlier, [Lists](http://help.rindle.com/boards-and-lists/adding-a-list) are the different stages in your [board(s)](http://help.rindle.com/boards-and-lists/adding-a-board). Tasks live in those lists.

## 100 - Adding tasks

You can add tasks to lists to help you keep track of tasks and stay ahead of your work on a regular basis.

To add a new task, click the "+" icon at the bottom of any list. After that, you will be prompted to fill out the name of your task. You can name the task anything you’d like — think of the task name as a mini description of your task.

Or, hover between tasks near the middle and a plus sign will appear to insert a task anywhere in the list.

## 200 - Using Tags on tasks

A [tag](https://help.rindle.com/cards/adding-tags-to-cards) is a way of categorizing a Rindle task by type, represented by a color and term. If you need to segment your tasks further beyond lists, tags is the way to do it.

Tags are flexible and can ultimately be used in many ways, so here is some [inspiration](https://help.rindle.com/getting-started/best-practices-for-workflows-in-rindle) for how tags can be used from our [Best practices for workflows](https://help.rindle.com/getting-started/best-practices-for-workflows-in-rindle) article.
