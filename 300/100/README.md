Then continue to add a group, start date, due date, select a board background and invite people to your board.

Your new board will contain three [Lists](https://help.rindle.com/organizing-your-work/boards-and-lists/lists) by default: Todo, Doing, and Done. Get some [inspiration](https://help.rindle.com/getting-started/rindle-workflow-inspiration) on workflows you can create with lists.
