If you can't find the person you want to add to your board when you type in their name or email address, they may not have a Rindle account. To invite them to Rindle, click Invite Users. This will invite them to Rindle and add them to the board in one step.

*Pro-tip: Don’t want to add a team member to a board? Rindle comes with “[direct assigning](https://help.rindle.com/organizing-your-work/tasks/direct-assignments)” which means you can assign tasks without inviting someone to a board! This helps keep board-clutter down while maintaining peak productivity.*
